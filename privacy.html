These websites are subject to the privacy rules of each of them, which Sportiza11 has no control over. The operator of the website the user is visiting controls how any information the user submits is used once they leave Sportiza11&apos;s servers (the user may determine where they are by looking at the URL in their browser&apos;s location bar). That policy might not be the same as Sportiza11&apos;s.
