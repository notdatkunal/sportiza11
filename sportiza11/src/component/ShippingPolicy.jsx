      <h3>Shipping and Delivery Policy</h3>
      <p>The shipping and delivery guidelines that follow apply to the financial transactions made on Sportiza11: </p>
        
          <h6>Digital Transactions:</h6>
          <p>
            Since Sportiza11 is an online fantasy sports marketplace, there isn't any actual <br />
            product delivery or shipment. Digital means are used for all transactions, including <br />
            deposits and withdrawals, via the website or mobile application.
          </p>
        

        
          <h6>Payment Methods:</h6>
          <p>
            Users can use the Sportiza11-supported payment methods to join leagues, deposit money, <br />
             and withdraw wins. These payment choices might include credit/debit cards, internet <br />
             banking, or other electronic means of making payments. It is the users' responsibility <br />
              to make sure their payment information is accurate.
          </p>
        

        
          <h6>Transaction Processing:</h6>
          <p>
            Sportiza11 makes every effort to handle withdrawals and deposits as soon as possible. <br />
             Delays, however, might be caused by uncontrollable circumstances like bank processing <br />
             timeframes or technological problems with payment gateways. While we will do our best to <br />
              immediately address any difficulties, Sportiza11 shall not be held liable for any delays <br />
               of this kind.
          </p>
        

        
          <h6>Transaction Fees:</h6>
          <p>
            For some financial transactions, such as deposits and withdrawals, Sportiza11 may <br />
             impose transaction fees. Before confirming the transaction, users will be informed of <br />
              these costs, if any.
          </p>
        

        
          <h6>Withdrawal conditions:</h6>
          <p>
            Before being able to make a withdrawal, users may need to meet certain conditions, such as <br />
            finishing a particular number of leagues or attaining a certain account amount. These <br />
            specifications are in place to guarantee equitable gaming and discourage platform misuse.
          </p>
        

        
          <h6>Security Measures:</h6>
          <p>
            Sportiza11 aims to give all financial transactions a dependable and safe platform. We <br />
            protect user data and keep financial information private by putting industry-standard <br />
            security measures in place.
          </p>
        

        
          <h6>Currency and Conversion:</h6>
          <p>
            Indian Rupees (INR) are the currency used by Sportiza11. Users may be exposed to currency <br />
             translation fees or fluctuations based on the current exchange rates when they <br />
              participate in leagues or make transactions in foreign currencies.
          </p>
        

        
          <h6>Customer care:</h6>
          <p>
            Users may get help from Sportiza11's customer care staff if they have any questions <br />
             or concerns about deposits, withdrawals, or transactions. We promise to immediately <br />
              address and fix any issues raised.
