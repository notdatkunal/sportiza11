      Users that make use of Sportiza11's services and fun features are not allowed to reverse any <br />

      and absolute discretion, to allow any user to cancel a transaction and get a refund of the  <br />

      cancel such a payment, they may do so in writing to Sportiza11 using their registered email  <br />
      address; alternatively, if the payment is made in order to participate in the paid version(s) of  <br />
