      <h6>Sportiza11: What is it?</h6>
      <p>
        One of the best fantasy sports games to play online cricket leagues is called <br />
        Sportiza11. Users may create their own squad based on their sports expertise and perhaps <br />
        earn money.
      </p>

      <h6>How can I register?</h6>
      <p>
        Users can register on Sportiza11 by completing a brief registration form found on <br />
         the website's homepage. On the other hand, users may also register straight through <br />
         Google+ or Facebook.
      </p>

      <h6>Why am I unable to access my account?</h6>
      <p>
        Users may experience difficulties with registration for a number of reasons. <br />
        The user may be inputting their email address or password incorrectly, which <br />
        is one of the main reasons they are unable to join up. Below the login option, <br />
        there is a Forgot Password link in case the user has forgotten their password. The user <br />
         will be sent to a new webpage after selecting the "Forgot Password" link. There, they <br />
         may reset their password by providing their registered cellphone number, and Sportiza11 <br />
         will give them an OTP. To reset their password, the user can input the OTP that was <br />
         supplied to them by Sportiza11.
      </p>

      <h6>Can I use Sportiza11 to create several accounts?</h6>
      <p>
        No. On Sportiza11, a person may only have one account under their name with legitimate <br />
        supporting documentation. For further information, please refer to the Fair Play policy.
      </p>

      <h6>Can I make changes to my information?</h6>
      <p>
        By utilizing their registered email address and password to access their <br />
        Sportiza11 accounts, individuals may effortlessly amend or update their personal data. <br />
         Users can amend or update their information by clicking on "Edit Profile" in the upper <br />
         right corner of the page after login into their Sportiza11 account. Once registered with <br />
         Sportiza11, individuals will be able to alter their basic information, such as their date <br />
         of birth, profile name, and address, but they will not be able to change their email <br />
         address, cellphone number, or team name.
      </p>

      <h6>I joined up, but I never received a confirmation email.</h6>
      <p>
        There might be two reasons why you might not have gotten a confirmation email from Sportiza11 following your registration:
          <p>The email sent by Sportiza11 may have been categorized as "Spam" and directed to your <br />
           mailbox's spam folder. In order to prevent any more annoyance, in such a situation, <br />
           kindly check your mailbox's spam folder and label Sportiza11 as "Not Spam." You should <br />
           also add Sportiza11 to your contacts.</p>
          <p>It's possible that the user entered their email address incorrectly while joining <br />
          with Sportiza11. Please use our Contact Us page to get in touch with us in such a <br />
          situation.</p>
      </p>

      <h6>I have little knowledge of cricket; can I still participate?</h6>
      <p>
        Sportiza11's online fantasy cricket game services are accessible to all players, <br />
        including those with less cricket knowledge. Therefore, even if you don't know much <br />
        about cricket, you may still play. Additionally, by providing you with information on <br />
        playing strategies, the "How to play" portion of the Sportiza11 website may help you with <br />
        the game.
